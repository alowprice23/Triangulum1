# PH1-BF3.T2 - Fix Response Handling for Large Results

## Objective
Improve the response handling system to efficiently process and manage large analysis results from agent operations

## Files to touch / create
- triangulum_lx/agents/response_handling.py
- triangulum_lx/agents/base_agent.py
- triangulum_lx/agents/message.py
- tests/unit/test_response_handling.py

## Definition-of-Done checklist
- [ ] Implement streaming response handling for large result sets
- [ ] Add chunking mechanism for large message content
- [ ] Create compression utilities for large analysis results
- [ ] Implement result pagination for multi-part responses
- [ ] Add proper serialization/deserialization for complex result objects
- [ ] Enhance logging for large response tracking
- [ ] Update message schema to support large result handling

## Test strategy
- Test with artificially large response payloads to verify handling
- Verify compression ratios for different types of analysis data
- Test chunking and reassembly with various payload sizes
- Validate pagination works correctly for user-facing results
- Benchmark performance for large payloads vs. small payloads

## Risk flags & dependencies
- Critical for folder-level analysis of large codebases
- Affects system memory usage and potential out-of-memory conditions
- Required for proper functioning of large-scale repair operations
- Must balance performance with data integrity
