# Triangulum End Plan

This document outlines the work completed to debug and enhance the `triangulum-aurora` codebase.

## Summary of Work

The primary goal of this task was to identify and fix a series of test failures that were preventing the system from running correctly. The investigation revealed a number of issues, including environment problems, dependency conflicts, and bugs in the agent implementations.

The following is a summary of the work completed:

1.  **Initial Investigation:** The initial investigation focused on identifying the root cause of the test failures. This involved running the tests, analyzing the error messages, and examining the code to identify potential problems.

2.  **Dependency Management:** The investigation revealed that a number of dependencies were missing or out of date. These dependencies were installed and updated to resolve the environment issues.

3.  **Orchestrator Redesign:** The `OrchestratorAgent` was identified as a major source of problems. The orchestrator was completely redesigned to be simpler, more testable, and fully asynchronous.

4.  **Test-Driven Development:** A test-driven development (TDD) approach was used to fix the remaining test failures. This involved writing a failing test for each bug, and then writing the code to make the test pass.

5.  **Error Reporting and Telemetry:** A robust error reporting and telemetry system was implemented to help identify and diagnose future problems. This system includes error logging, performance monitoring, and progress tracking.

6.  **API Key Masking:** All API keys were masked to prevent them from being accidentally exposed.

## Key Accomplishments

*   All test failures were fixed.
*   The `OrchestratorAgent` was completely redesigned.
*   A robust error reporting and telemetry system was implemented.
*   All API keys were masked.

## Future Work

*   The `OrchestratorAgent` could be further enhanced to support more complex workflows.
*   The error reporting and telemetry system could be integrated with a third-party monitoring service.
*   The test suite could be expanded to cover more edge cases.
