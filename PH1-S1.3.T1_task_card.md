# PH1-S1.3.T1: Enhance Strategy Agent Planning

## Objective
Enhance the Strategy Agent's planning capabilities with improved bug pattern recognition, strategy template management, and contextual strategy optimization.

## Files to Touch / Create
- triangulum_lx/agents/strategy_agent.py
- tests/unit/test_strategy_agent.py
- examples/enhanced_strategy_agent_demo.py

## Definition-of-Done Checklist
- [ ] Implement advanced bug pattern recognition with context-aware classification
- [ ] Add learning from historical strategy successes and failures
- [ ] Create strategy optimization based on code relationship context
- [ ] Implement prioritization of strategies based on past success rates
- [ ] Add dynamic strategy template generation from successful patterns
- [ ] Improve confidence calculation with historical performance data
- [ ] Enhance error handling for edge cases in strategy formulation
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Develop demonstration example showing enhanced planning capabilities

## Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Expand tests for all new strategy agent functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Test integration with other agents (Implementation, Verification)
- **Property Tests**: Verify that strategy confidence calculations are accurate
- **Mutation Tests**: Ensure robustness by introducing variations in bug reports

## Risk Flags & Dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Requires code relationship context from the Relationship Analyst Agent
- **Risk**: Balancing confidence in strategy recommendations with actual success rates
- **Risk**: Potential for strategy over-optimization on common patterns
- **Risk**: Resource consumption for learning from historical strategies
