# PH1-BF2.T1 - Fix Orchestrator Agent Task Distribution

## Objective
Improve the Orchestrator Agent's task distribution system to ensure proper routing and handling of tasks across specialized agents

## Files to touch / create
- triangulum_lx/agents/orchestrator_agent.py
- tests/unit/test_orchestrator_agent.py

## Definition-of-Done checklist
- [ ] Fix task distribution logic to properly assign tasks to appropriate agents
- [ ] Implement priority-based task scheduling
- [ ] Add error handling for agent unavailability scenarios
- [ ] Create a task queue for handling multiple concurrent requests
- [ ] Implement proper task status tracking and reporting
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed task distributions
- [ ] Update documentation with task distribution patterns

## Test strategy
- Verify task routing logic works correctly for different task types
- Test priority-based scheduling with mixed priority tasks
- Validate error handling and recovery for failed distributions
- Test with multiple concurrent tasks to ensure proper queuing
- Verify task status reporting is accurate throughout execution

## Risk flags & dependencies
- Critical component for multi-agent coordination
- Depends on properly functioning MessageBus
- Required for folder-level bug detection and repair workflows
- May require optimization for large workloads
