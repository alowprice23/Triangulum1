# PH1-BF2.T3 - Implementation of Timeout and Progress Tracking

## Summary
Successfully implemented robust timeout handling and detailed progress tracking throughout the Triangulum system. This enhancement improves reliability and observability during long-running operations, providing both graceful cancellation of timed-out tasks and detailed progress information for monitoring.

## Implementation Details

### Core Monitoring System Enhancements
- Leveraged existing `OperationProgress` and `OperationTracker` classes in `triangulum_lx/core/monitor.py`
- Added support for percentage completion estimation based on elapsed time
- Added milestone event emission (25%, 50%, 75% progress) for dashboard integration
- Implemented graceful cancellation for timed-out operations

### BaseAgent Integration
- Enhanced `BaseAgent` with operation tracking methods that connect to the monitoring system
- Added handling for operation timeouts with customizable cancellation behavior
- Implemented progress tracking with detailed metadata support

### OrchestratorAgent Enhancements
- Added a dedicated progress tracking thread that monitors active operations
- Implemented configurable timeout grace periods to prevent premature termination
- Added automatic progress reporting for long-running workflows
- Enhanced workflow step functions with progress updates
- Added detailed reporting for timeouts with appropriate error handling
- Integrated progress tracking with the messaging system for system-wide visibility

### Configuration Options
Added the following configurable parameters:
- `progress_update_interval`: Frequency of progress updates (default: 5.0 seconds)
- `default_task_timeout`: Default timeout for tasks (default: 300.0 seconds)
- `enable_progress_events`: Toggle for progress milestone events (default: true)
- `timeout_grace_period`: Grace period before cancelling timed-out operations (default: 10.0 seconds)

### Dashboard Integration
- Added operation metrics to the monitoring system
- Enhanced status broadcasting for dashboard visualization
- Added progress event emission for milestone tracking

## Testing
Comprehensive test coverage was added via `tests/unit/test_timeout_handling.py`, including:
- Unit tests for the operation progress lifecycle
- Tests for timeout detection and handling
- Tests for progress tracking accuracy
- Integration tests for the orchestrator agent's timeout handling

## Benefits
1. **Improved Reliability**: Long-running operations now have proper timeout handling
2. **Enhanced Observability**: Detailed progress tracking for all operations
3. **Better User Experience**: More granular feedback during folder-level operations
4. **Graceful Recovery**: Proper cancellation of timed-out operations prevents resource leaks
5. **Dashboard Integration**: Progress events feed into monitoring dashboards

## Future Enhancements
- Add adaptive timeout calculation based on operation complexity
- Implement retries with exponential backoff for certain timeouts
- Add user-configurable timeout policies at the task level
