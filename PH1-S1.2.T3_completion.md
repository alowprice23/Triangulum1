   - Implemented message type filtering
   - Added sender/receiver filtering logic

4. **Subscription Model**
   - Created dynamic topic subscription mechanism
   - Implemented dynamic message handling with callbacks
   - Added subscription management for runtime updates

5. **Backward Compatibility**

   - Ensured graceful fallback for legacy code
   - Preserved original interface while extending functionality

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented thread-safe operations with lock management
   - Added optimized message delivery mechanisms
   - Created efficient message routing algorithms

7. **Thought Chain Persistence Integration**
   - Implemented integration with ThoughtChain for message persistence
   - Added automatic conversion of messages to chain nodes
   - Implemented relationship tracking between messages
   - Added conversation tracking and metadata storage
   - Implemented file-based persistence with backup capabilities

8. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Added comprehensive error handling for all operations
   - Implemented delivery retry mechanism with configurable parameters
   - Added delivery status tracking and reporting
   - Created recovery mechanisms for failed message deliveries

9. **Logging and Tracing**
   - Added detailed logging for all message operations
   - Implemented message flow tracing
   - Added delivery status logging
   - Created diagnostic logging for troubleshooting

10. **Unit Tests**
    - Implemented comprehensive unit tests for all functionality
    - Added tests for error conditions and edge cases
    - Created tests for thought chain integration

- `examples/enhanced_message_bus_thought_chain_demo.py` - Demo application showing thought chain integration

## Technical Details

### Thought Chain Integration

The thought chain integration was implemented by:

1. Adding storage capabilities for messages in thought chains
2. Converting messages to ChainNode objects with appropriate thought types
3. Maintaining relationships between messages (reply chains)
4. Persisting chains to disk with versioning and backups
5. Providing retrieval mechanisms for thought chains
6. Adding conversation tracking for message organization

### Message Routing

Message routing was enhanced with:

1. Topic-based subscription mechanism
2. Message filtering by type, content, and sender
3. Delivery guarantees with retry mechanism
4. Tracking of message delivery status

### Public API

The Enhanced Message Bus provides a comprehensive API:

- `subscribe_to_topic`: Subscribe to specific message topics
- `unsubscribe_from_topic`: Unsubscribe from topics
- `publish_to_topic`: Publish messages to specific topics
- `publish`: Publish messages to subscribers (with optional topic)
- `get_thought_chain`: Retrieve thought chain for a conversation
- `list_thought_chains`: List all available thought chains
- `get_delivery_status`: Get delivery status of a message
- `wait_for_delivery`: Wait for message delivery with timeout

## Demo and Verification

The implementation includes a demo application (`examples/enhanced_message_bus_thought_chain_demo.py`) that demonstrates:

1. Creating an Enhanced Message Bus with thought chain persistence
2. Sending messages between agents
3. Creating message reply chains
4. Retrieving and displaying the thought chain
5. Showing how the message relationships are preserved

## Next Steps

1. Integration with the broader Triangulum system
2. Performance testing with high message volumes
3. Additional demo applications for advanced use cases
4. Documentation updates for new capabilities
