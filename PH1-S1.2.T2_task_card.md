# PH1-S1.2.T2: Implement Thought Chain Persistence

## Objective
Implement persistence mechanisms for thought chains to enable saving and loading chains from storage, maintaining agent reasoning histories across sessions, and providing better continuity for complex problem-solving workflows.

## Files to Touch / Create
- triangulum_lx/agents/thought_chain.py

## Definition-of-Done Checklist
- [ ] Implement file-based persistence for thought chains
- [ ] Add methods to save chains to disk in JSON format
- [ ] Add methods to load chains from disk
- [ ] Implement automatic backup/versioning mechanism
- [ ] Add error handling for file operations
- [ ] Ensure thread safety for file operations
- [ ] Create compression option for large chains
- [ ] Add configuration options for persistence location
- [ ] Add unit tests for persistence functionality

## Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Add tests in tests/unit/test_thought_chain.py to verify persistence functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Create tests to verify chains can be saved and loaded correctly
- **Property Tests**: Test saving and loading chains of various sizes and complexity
- **Mutation Tests**: Test persistence functionality with malformed or corrupted files

## Risk Flags & Dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Requires filesystem access and permissions
- **Risk**: Large chains might cause performance issues during serialization/deserialization
- **Risk**: Concurrent access to files could cause data corruption without proper locking
- **Risk**: Version compatibility issues when loading older chain formats
