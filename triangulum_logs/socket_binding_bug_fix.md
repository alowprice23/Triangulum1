# Socket Binding Bug Fix - Triangulum Dashboard

## Issue Description
A socket binding error was occurring when attempting to run the Triangulum dashboard:
```
ERROR: [Errno 13] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 8080): an attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of this issue was identified as:

1. The `dashboard_stub.py` file was originally configured to use port 8083 by default:
   ```python
   def run_dashboard(host: str = "127.0.0.1", port: int = 8083):
   ```

2. However, in `start_triangulum.py`, there was a reference to the dashboard running on port 8080:
   ```python
   print("   â€¢ Start the dashboard: 'python triangulum_lx/monitoring/dashboard_stub.py'")
   print("     (If port 8080 is busy, dashboard will show an access error - this is normal)")
   ```

3. This inconsistency led to confusion and potential port conflicts, particularly when other applications might be using port 8080 or when the user has permission issues on that port.

## Fix Implementation
The fix went through multiple iterations to address the socket binding issue effectively:

### Initial Approach
Initially, we tried to make the dashboard start on port 8080 by default (to match documentation) with fallback logic:
```python
def run_dashboard(host: str = "127.0.0.1", port: int = 8080):
```

### Refined Solution
However, after testing, we found that permission issues were still occurring on port 8080. Our final solution uses:

1. Setting the default port back to 8083 (which worked previously) but trying 8080 as a fallback to maintain compatibility with documentation:
   ```python
   def run_dashboard(host: str = "127.0.0.1", port: int = 8083):
   ```

2. Using socket pre-checking to verify port availability before attempting to bind:
   ```python
   # First check if the port is already in use
   sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   sock.settimeout(1)
   result = sock.connect_ex((host, current_port))
   sock.close()
   
   if result == 0:
       # Port is already in use
       print(f"Port {current_port} is already in use, trying next port...")
       logger.warning(f"Port {current_port} is already in use")
       continue
   ```

3. Adding comprehensive port fallback logic with clear user feedback:
   ```python
   # List of ports to try in order
   ports_to_try = [port, 8080, 8081, 8082, 8084, 8085]
   
   # Make sure we don't try the same port twice
   ports_to_try = list(dict.fromkeys(ports_to_try))
   
   # Try each port in sequence
   for current_port in ports_to_try:
       try:
           print(f"Starting dashboard on http://{host}:{current_port}")
           logger.info(f"Attempting to start dashboard on {host}:{current_port}")
           
           # Port checking and server startup code...
           
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Failed to start on port {current_port}: {e}")
           logger.warning(f"Failed to bind to port {current_port}: {e}")
           continue
   ```

## Benefits of the Fix
1. **Improved Reliability**: The dashboard now starts with a port that's likely to be available (8083) but still tries the documented port (8080) for consistency.
2. **Proactive Port Checking**: Socket checking prevents attempting to bind to ports that are already in use, reducing unnecessary errors.
3. **Better Error Handling**: The system gracefully tries alternative ports (8080, 8081, 8082, 8084, 8085) if the primary port is unavailable.
4. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, informative messages guide users through the port selection process.
5. **Robust Logging**: All port binding attempts and failures are properly logged for debugging.
6. **Deduplication**: The system ensures that duplicate ports aren't tried multiple times, improving efficiency.

## Code Relationships
The following files are related to this fix:
1. `triangulum_lx/monitoring/dashboard_stub.py` - Contains the main dashboard implementation and server startup logic
2. `start_triangulum.py` - References the dashboard functionality in user instructions

## Testing
The fix can be tested by:
1. Running `python triangulum_lx/monitoring/dashboard_stub.py` and verifying it starts on port 8080
2. Occupying port 8080 with another application and verifying the dashboard falls back to an alternative port
3. Running `python start_triangulum.py` and verifying that all components start successfully

## Debug Process
The debugging process utilized:
1. Code relationship analysis to identify dashboard-related components
2. Root cause analysis to identify the port binding issue
3. Implementation of a robust solution that handles port conflicts gracefully
