[21:34:17]   ===== Triangulum Self-Healing Enhancements =====
[21:34:17]   Applied 8 enhancements:
[21:34:17]   1. Created adaptive timeout manager
[21:34:17]   2. Enhanced timeout handling in debug_with_relationships.py
[21:34:17]   3. Created enhanced agent coordinator
[21:34:17]   4. Enhanced agent coordination in debug_with_relationships.py
[21:34:17]   5. Created fix impact tracker
[21:34:17]   6. Enhanced folder debugger with fix impact tracking
[21:34:17]   7. Created triangulum_self_heal.py - Enhanced self-healing system
[21:34:17]   8. Created triangulum_monitor.py - Continuous monitoring system
[21:34:17]   Run 'python triangulum_self_heal.py' to activate the enhanced self-healing system.
[21:34:17] Enhancement complete. All required files created.
