# Triangulum Startup Issues and Fixes

## Overview

This document explains why the Triangulum folder healer was failing to start properly and documents the fixes that were applied.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Command Line Arguments Issue

**Problem:** 
The `run_triangulum_with_monitoring.py` script had an issue with command-line arguments. It expected a folder path and didn't recognize 'main' as a valid parameter.

**Fix:**
Use the script with the correct arguments - provide only the folder path.

### 2. Missing `_handle_query` Method

**Problem:**
The `OrchestratorAgent` class was missing a required `_handle_query` method implementation:
```
Error during folder healing: Can't instantiate abstract class OrchestratorAgent without an implementation for abstract method '_handle_query'
```

**Fix:**
The `fix_orchestrator_agent.py` script added the missing `_handle_query` method to the `OrchestratorAgent` class.

### 3. Missing `register_handler` Method in MessageBus

**Problem:**
The `MessageBus` class didn't have a `register_handler` method which the OrchestratorAgent was expecting:
```
Error during folder healing: 'MessageBus' object has no attribute 'register_handler'
```

**Fix:**
The `fix_message_bus.py` script added a compatibility `register_handler` method to the `MessageBus` class that maps to the existing `subscribe` method.

### 4. Parameter Naming Mismatch

**Problem:**
In multiple places, the `AgentMessage` class was being instantiated with a 'recipient' parameter instead of the correct 'receiver' parameter:
```
Error during folder healing: AgentMessage.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'recipient'
```

**Fix:**
The `fix_agent_message_params.py` and direct edits to `triangulum_folder_healer.py` replaced all instances of 'recipient=' with 'receiver=' to match the expected parameter name.

### 5. Missing Imports

**Problem:**
The 'itertools' module was imported in the main() function but used in the progress_monitor function, leading to a NameError:
```
NameError: name 'itertools' is not defined. Did you forget to import 'itertools'?
```

**Fix:**
Moved the 'itertools' import to the top-level imports so it's available for the progress_monitor function.

## Current Status

The Triangulum Folder Healer is now able to start and begin processing, though there may be additional issues with the actual folder analysis and healing workflow that need to be addressed.

## Additional Notes

The system appears to have minimal progress tracking visible in the terminal, which can make it difficult for users to know what's happening during longer operations. The bug detector step times out or fails for example files, which suggests there may be additional issues with the actual detection and repair functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate why the bug detector step is failing or timing out
2. Improve progress tracking and user feedback in the terminal
3. Test with different folders to see if the issue is specific to the example files
