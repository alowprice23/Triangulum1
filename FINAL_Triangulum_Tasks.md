# FINAL Triangulum Tasks

This document tracks all remaining tasks required to complete the Triangulum project. Tasks are organized by phase and sprint, with detailed implementation requirements and acceptance criteria.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Tasks are marked `[COMPLETED]`, `[PARTIAL]`, or `[PENDING]` based on current implementation status
- Tasks are ordered by dependency and priority
- **Triangulum is a fully operational AGENTIC SYSTEM with LLM-powered components that communicate and coordinate autonomously.** Extensive testing has confirmed that the system is functionally agentic with internal LLM communication chains.
- The core issue is that the system's agentic activity lacks sufficient visibility, making it appear frozen during internal processing when it is actually actively working.
- The system requires **real-time progress visibility** to expose internal LLM processing activity, addressing the "freezing" terminal issue.
- **FixWurx integration serves as the primary demonstration platform** for the agentic system's capabilities, providing a real-world environment for testing and verification.

## LLM-Powered Agentic System Design

Triangulum is designed as a network of specialized LLM agents that work together to analyze, detect, and repair code issues. These agents communicate through a structured message bus system and maintain their internal reasoning processes via thought chains. The key challenge is to make this internal activity visible and understandable to the user.

Key agentic elements include:
- Multi-agent coordination through the orchestrator agent
- LLM-powered decision making within specialized agents
- Continuous feedback loops between agent components
- Thought chain sharing for complex reasoning tasks
- **Real-time progress reporting from all internal LLM processes to address the "frozen terminal" problem**
- **Transparent visibility into LLM reasoning chains**
- **Inter-agent communication for error detection and resolution**

## Agentic System Testing Protocol

Testing has confirmed the agentic nature of the system. Triangulum uses a comprehensive testing approach focused on:

1. **Agent Communication Verification**: Testing message passing between different LLM-powered agents to ensure proper coordination.
2. **Thought Chain Validation**: Verifying that reasoning steps are properly captured, linked, and shared between agents.
3. **Progress Visibility**: Ensuring all internal LLM processing is transparent to users with real-time updates, directly addressing the core issue of the system appearing to be stuck.
4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Testing how multiple agents work together to solve complex problems.
5. **FixWurx Integration**: Using the FixWurx codebase as a real-world test environment to verify the agentic system's capabilities.
6. **LLM Feedback Testing**: Verifying that the system can use LLM components to identify and report internal issues.

This testing protocol confirms Triangulum's agentic capabilities and ensures they are fully visible to users.
