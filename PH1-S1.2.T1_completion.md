# PH1-S1.2.T1 Completion: Enhanced Message Schema Validation

## Task Summary
The message schema validation system has been successfully enhanced to ensure all agent messages adhere to the defined schema and prevent malformed messages from entering the system.

## Changes Made

1. **Added TriangulumValidationError Class**
   - Added a new exception class to triangulum_lx/core/exceptions.py
   - Provides detailed validation error information including field, schema path, and value

2. **Enhanced MessageSchemaValidator**
   - Added comprehensive validation for all message types
   - Implemented detailed error reporting with context for easier debugging
   - Added schema version handling for future compatibility
   - Enhanced validation of nested properties

3. **Improved Validation Logic**
   - Added field presence validation for required fields based on message type
   - Implemented proper support for optional fields in validation
   - Added performance monitoring for validation operations
   - Created specific validators for each message type

4. **Enhanced Template Generation**
   - Extended template generation to create valid messages for all message types
   - Ensured templates include all required fields for each message type

5. **Updated Testing**
   - Updated unit tests to verify all new validation functionality
   - All tests are now passing with the enhanced validation system

## Test Results
All 16 tests in tests/unit/test_message_schema_validator.py now pass successfully, confirming that the implementation meets all requirements specified in the task.

## Benefits
- More robust message validation prevents malformed messages from entering the system
- Better error messages make debugging validation issues easier
- Improved performance through optimized validation
- Support for nested properties ensures complex message structures are properly validated
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures all aspects of validation work correctly
