# PH1-BF1.T3 - Fix Message Bus Conversational Memory

## Objective
Enhance the conversational memory tracking in MessageBus to correctly store and retrieve conversation chains between agents

## Files to touch / create
- triangulum_lx/agents/message_bus.py
- tests/unit/test_message_bus.py

## Definition-of-Done checklist
- [x] Fix the get_message_chain method to properly handle parent-child relationships
- [x] Ensure conversational memory is properly stored and maintained
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for missing messages or conversations
- [x] Implement conversation cleanup mechanism to prevent memory leaks
- [x] Update documentation for conversation tracking methods
- [x] Add proper tests for conversation chain functionality

## Test strategy
- Verify message chains are built correctly with parent-child relationships
- Test with multiple agents in a single conversation
- Test error cases (missing messages, invalid IDs)
- Validate conversation memory persists across multiple message exchanges
- Verify cleanup functionality works as expected

## Risk flags & dependencies
- Critical component for agent-to-agent communication
- Required for proper agent conversation flow and context maintenance
- All agents depend on this for maintaining conversation history
- Must be thread-safe for multi-agent parallel operations
