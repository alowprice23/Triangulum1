# Triangulum Agentic System Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to properly run and demonstrate the Triangulum agentic system. Triangulum is a fully agentic system with LLM-powered components that communicate with each other to analyze and repair code.

## Understanding the Agentic Nature of Triangulum

Triangulum operates as a multi-agent system where several specialized LLM-powered agents communicate and coordinate to accomplish complex tasks:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates the overall workflow between agents
2. **Relationship Analyst Agent**: Analyzes code relationships and dependencies
3. **Bug Detector Agent**: Identifies bugs and issues in code
4. **Verification Agent**: Validates code changes and fixes
5. **Priority Analyzer Agent**: Determines importance and urgency of tasks

These agents don't operate in isolation - they actively communicate with each other via a message bus, share context, and collaborate to accomplish tasks.

## How to Run the Tests

To demonstrate the agentic system capabilities, run the following commands in a standard Command Prompt (cmd.exe) rather than PowerShell to avoid formatting issues:

### Option 1: Run the comprehensive demo
```
python run_triangulum_agentic_demo.py
```

### Option 2: Run individual tests
```
python test_agentic_system.py
```
```
python test_timeout_progress.py
```

## What You'll See During the Tests

When running the tests, you'll observe:

1. **Real-time progress visibility**: The system shows detailed progress updates during operations
2. **Inter-agent communication**: Messages passed between agents with specific roles
3. **LLM integration**: Simulation of LLM queries and responses within agents
4. **Timeout handling**: Proper handling of long-running operations
5. **Continuous activity**: Proof that the system isn't freezing but continuously processing

## Progress Visibility

One key improvement in the system is enhanced progress visibility. What previously appeared as "freezing" was actually the system working internally without providing adequate feedback. The improvements now show:

- Percentage-based completion tracking
- ETA estimates for operations
- Step-by-step progress through multi-stage operations
- Real-time status updates from individual agents

## Test Descriptions

### Agent Test
Tests inter-agent communication, thought chain visualization, and LLM integration. Shows how agents coordinate through message passing.

### Progress Visibility Test
Demonstrates the system's ability to show real-time progress during operations, with timeout handling and cancellation support.

### Full Demo
Runs a complete workflow showing all agentic components working together.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors with PowerShell related to backticks (```), try running the scripts in Command Prompt (cmd.exe) instead.

## Conclusion

The tests and demonstrations confirm that Triangulum is a fully agentic system with multiple LLM-powered agents that communicate and coordinate with each other. The system isn't freezing during long operations - it's continuously processing with visible progress indicators showing its activity.
