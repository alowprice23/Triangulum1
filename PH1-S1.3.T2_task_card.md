# PH1-S1.3.T2: Improve Implementation Agent Execution

## Objective
Enhance the Implementation Agent's execution capabilities with improved code generation, patch creation, and execution monitoring to ensure more reliable and efficient bug fixes.

## Files to Touch / Create
- triangulum_lx/agents/implementation_agent.py
- tests/unit/test_implementation_agent.py
- examples/enhanced_implementation_agent_demo.py

## Definition-of-Done Checklist
- [ ] Implement advanced code analysis for patch generation
- [ ] Add runtime environment detection for language-specific patch creation
- [ ] Create dynamic patch validation before application
- [ ] Implement backup and rollback mechanisms for failed implementations
- [ ] Add implementation metrics collection for performance analysis
- [ ] Enhance error handling for edge cases in code modification
- [ ] Implement progressive patch application with validation steps
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Develop demonstration example showing enhanced implementation capabilities

## Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Expand tests for all new implementation agent functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Test integration with Strategy Agent and Verification Agent
- **Property Tests**: Verify correctness of generated patches
- **Mutation Tests**: Test robustness by introducing variations in code

## Risk Flags & Dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Requires coordinated validation with Verification Agent
- **Risk**: Potential for source code corruption during patch application
- **Risk**: Language-specific challenges in code generation
- **Risk**: Atomicity concerns during multi-file modifications
