# Verification Agent Next-Gen: Polyglot Verification with AI Assistance

## Unified Architecture for Advanced Verification

The next generation of the Verification Agent can implement all four target capabilities through a single unified architecture we call **VerifyX** - a language-agnostic, extensible, metrics-driven verification platform with embedded AI capabilities.

## Key Innovation: Plugin-based Language-Specific Verification

The core innovation is a compact plugin architecture where verification capabilities are implemented as small, specialized "verifiers" that all share a common interface.

## AI-Assisted Verification: Self-Improving Pipeline

AI capabilities are embedded throughout the verification process to enable a self-improving pipeline.
