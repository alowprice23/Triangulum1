# Triangulum: Path to Production Readiness

## Overview

This document outlines the critical next steps required to transform the current Triangulum self-healing prototype into a fully functional, production-ready system.

## 1. Multi-Agent Communication Framework

The existing system has a solid foundation for multi-agent communication, but it can be enhanced by:

- **Standardizing the Message Passing Protocol**: Defining a standardized JSON schema for inter-agent messages.
- **Implementing Conversational Memory**: Creating a persistent memory system allowing agents to reference previous interactions.
- **Enhancing Thought Chaining**: Improving the mechanism for agents to build on each other's reasoning.

## 2. Scaling to Folder-Level Repairs

The system can be scaled to handle large-scale repairs by:

- **Implementing Incremental Analysis**: Avoiding re-analyzing unchanged files.
- **Creating Sophisticated Dependency Graphs**: Understanding cross-file relationships.
- **Developing Prioritization Algorithms**: Prioritizing which files to analyze first.

## 3. Production-Grade Infrastructure

The system can be made production-ready by:

- **Optimizing Performance**: Minimizing token usage and implementing caching.
- **Enhancing Security**: Implementing secure sandboxing and permission management.
- **Improving Monitoring and Observability**: Implementing comprehensive logging and a visualization dashboard.

## 4. Enhanced Learning Capabilities

The system's learning capabilities can be enhanced by:

- **Implementing Repair Pattern Learning**: Identifying common patterns in successful repairs.
- **Integrating a Feedback Loop**: Systematically collecting and incorporating user feedback.
- **Creating a Continuous Improvement System**: Automatically adjusting system parameters based on performance data.
