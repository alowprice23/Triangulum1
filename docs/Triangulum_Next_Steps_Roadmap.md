# Triangulum: Path to Production Readiness

## Overview

This document outlines the critical next steps required to transform the current Triangulum self-healing prototype into a fully functional, production-ready system capable of handling real-world deployment scenarios. The roadmap focuses specifically on multi-agent communication, large-scale folder analysis, and enterprise-grade deployment requirements.

## 1. Multi-Agent Communication Framework

  - Problem context
  - Analysis results
  - Suggested actions
  - Confidence scores
  - Relationship metadata
- **Conversational Memory**: Implement a persistent memory system allowing agents to reference previous interactions
- **Thought Chaining**: Create a mechanism for agents to build on each other's reasoning, enabling complex multi-step problem solving

#### 1.3 Specialized Agent Roles
- **Relationship Analyst Agent**: Specializes in understanding codebase relationships
- **Bug Identification Agent**: Focuses on identifying potential bugs from test failures and code patterns
- **Strategy Formulation Agent**: Plans repair approaches based on bug analysis
- **Implementation Agent**: Generates concrete code patches
- **Verification Agent**: Verifies that patches work correctly and don't introduce new issues

#### 1.4 Agent Orchestration
- **Dynamic Agent Allocation**: Automatically determine which agents need to be involved based on task complexity
- **Parallel Processing**: Allow multiple agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a problem
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implement mechanisms to resolve conflicting suggestions between agents

## 2. Scaling to Folder-Level Repairs

### Current State
The existing system can handle single-file repairs but struggles with large-scale repairs spanning multiple files or entire folders.

### Required Enhancements

#### 2.1 Large-Scale Relationship Analysis
- **Incremental Analysis**: Implement incremental analysis to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- **Dependency Graphing**: Create sophisticated dependency graphs to understand cross-file relationships
- **Prioritization Algorithms**: Develop algorithms to prioritize which files to analyze first based on:
  - Centrality in dependency graph
  - Historical bug frequency
  - Recent changes
  - Test coverage

#### 2.2 Distributed Processing
- **Job Scheduler**: Implement a job scheduler to parallelize analysis and repair tasks
- **Work Queue Management**: Create a robust work queue system to handle thousands of files
- **Resource Management**: Implement adaptive resource allocation based on file complexity and priority

#### 2.3 Large Codebase Navigation
- **Semantic Code Chunking**: Develop techniques to semantically chunk large codebases for more effective processing
- **Hierarchical Representation**: Create multi-level representations of code (module → file → class → function)
- **Efficient Search Mechanisms**: Implement code-aware search capabilities to quickly locate relevant sections

#### 2.4 Multi-File Repair Coordination
- **Atomic Transaction Management**: Ensure all related files are updated in a coordinated, atomic manner
- **Cross-File Consistency Verification**: Verify that changes across multiple files are consistent
- **Rollback Capability**: Implement sophisticated rollback mechanisms that can revert changes across many files

## 3. Production-Grade Infrastructure

### Current State
The existing system is designed for demonstration and testing rather than production deployment.

### Required Enhancements

#### 3.1 Performance Optimization
- **Token Usage Optimization**: Minimize token usage through context compression and relevance filtering

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Add scanning of generated patches for potential security issues

#### 3.3 Monitoring and Observability
- **Detailed Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging of all agent actions and decisions
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators such as:
  - Repair success rate
  - Time to repair
  - Token usage efficiency
  - User intervention frequency
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Create an intuitive dashboard for monitoring system health and activity

#### 3.4 Integration Capabilities
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Enable seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines
- **VCS System Hooks**: Implement hooks for major version control systems
- **Issue Tracker Integration**: Create bidirectional communication with issue tracking systems
- **API Gateway**: Develop a comprehensive API for external system integration

## 4. Enhanced Learning Capabilities

### Current State
The system has limited ability to learn from past repairs or improve over time.

### Required Enhancements

#### 4.1 Repair Pattern Learning
- **Success Pattern Recognition**: Identify common patterns in successful repairs
- **Failure Analysis**: Learn from unsuccessful repair attempts
- **Repair Templates**: Generate and refine templates for common bug types

#### 4.2 Feedback Loop Integration
- **User Feedback Processing**: Systematically collect and incorporate user feedback
- **Test Result Analysis**: Learn from patterns in test results before and after repairs

- **Parameter Optimization**: Automatically adjust agent parameters based on performance data
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Distill successful repair strategies into more efficient forms

## 5. Enterprise Deployment Readiness

### Current State
The system lacks enterprise-grade deployment options and management capabilities.

### Required Enhancements

#### 5.1 Deployment Options
- **Containerization**: Create Docker containers for all system components
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Develop Kubernetes manifests for orchestrated deployment
- **On-premises Solution**: Package system for secure on-premises deployment
