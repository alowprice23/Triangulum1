# v2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document describes the steps required to implement the v2 shell. The implementation will be done in several phases, starting with the creation of the new shell files, followed by the modification of the existing files, and finally the deletion of the old shell files.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Create the new shell files

The first phase of the implementation will be to create the new shell files. The following files will be created in the `triangulum_lx/shell` directory:

*   **`__init__.py`**: This file will initialize the shell.
*   **`main.py`**: This file will contain the main entry point for the shell.
*   **`commands.py`**: This file will contain the definitions for the shell commands.
*   **`interactive.py`**: This file will contain the implementation of the interactive shell.
*   **`scripting.py`**: This file will contain the implementation of the scripting engine.
*   **`agents.py`**: This file will contain the implementation of the agent communication system.

### Phase 2: Modify the existing files

The second phase of the implementation will be to modify the existing files to use the new shell. The following files will be modified:

*   **`triangulum_lx/scripts/cli.py`**: This file will be modified to use the new shell.
*   **`setup.py`**: This file will be modified to include the new shell in the installation.

### Phase 3: Delete the old shell files

The third phase of the implementation will be to delete the old shell files. The following file will be deleted:

*   **`triangulum_lx/human/interactive_mode.py`**

## Testing

The new shell will be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly. The following tests will be performed:

*   **Unit tests:** Unit tests will be written for the new shell files.
*   **Integration tests:** Integration tests will be written to test the integration of the new shell with the rest of the system.
*   **Manual testing:** The new shell will be tested manually to ensure that it is working as expected.
