# Triangulum Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Overview

This testing plan outlines a comprehensive approach to verify that Triangulum is fully functional.

## Test Environment Setup

To properly test the Triangulum agentic system, set up your environment as follows:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest
   ```

## Running the System

To run the Triangulum system, use the `triangulum` command-line interface (CLI):

```bash
python -m triangulum_lx.scripts.cli --help
```
