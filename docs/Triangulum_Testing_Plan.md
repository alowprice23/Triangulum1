## Validation Criteria

The Triangulum system will be considered fully functional if:

1. All core feature tests pass successfully
2. The FixWurx project is successfully repaired
3. The repaired FixWurx project passes all its own tests
4. No new issues are introduced during the repair process
5. The learning system shows evidence of improvement over multiple repair cycles

## Test Execution Plan

1. Run tests in the order listed, as later tests often depend on earlier ones
2. Document the actual result of each test as it is executed
3. For any failed tests, document the specific error and its impact on the overall system
4. After addressing any failures, re-run the affected tests and their dependencies
5. Once all tests pass, perform a final end-to-end validation of the repaired FixWurx project

## Final Validation

After all tests have been executed and passed, perform these final validation steps:

1. Run the full test suite of the FixWurx project
2. Verify that all previously identified bugs are fixed
3. Verify that no new bugs have been introduced
4. Verify that the FixWurx project functions correctly in its intended environment

If all these validation steps pass, then Triangulum can be considered fully functional and the FixWurx project successfully repaired.
