# Triangulum Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the current Triangulum implementation.

## Core System Structure

Triangulum is organized into a modular architecture with the following key components:

```
triangulum_lx/
├── agents/           # Agent system for orchestrating repairs
├── core/             # Core system functionality
├── goal/             # Goal management and prioritization
├── human/            # Human interaction and feedback
├── learning/         # Learning and optimization
├── monitoring/       # System monitoring and metrics
├── providers/        # LLM provider integrations
├── quantum/          # Experimental quantum features
├── scripts/          # Utility scripts
├── spec/             # Formal specifications
├── tests/            # Test suite
├── tooling/          # Code analysis and repair tools
```

## Key Components

### `triangulum_lx/core/engine.py`

The main `TriangulumEngine` class, which is responsible for orchestrating the entire system.

### `triangulum_lx/scripts/cli.py`

The command-line interface (CLI) for the Triangulum system. It is the main entry point for interacting with the system.

### `triangulum_lx/agents/meta_agent.py`

The `MetaAgent` class, which is the central coordinator for all agentic activities.

### `triangulum_lx/tooling/repair.py`

The `PatcherAgent` class, which is responsible for generating and applying patches to fix bugs.
