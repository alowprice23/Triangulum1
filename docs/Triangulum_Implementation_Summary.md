```

## Implemented Self-Healing Functionality

The following key components have been implemented as part of the self-healing system:

### 1. Code Relationship Analysis

The code relationship analyzer (`triangulum_lx/tooling/code_relationship_analyzer.py`) and relationship context provider (`triangulum_lx/tooling/relationship_context_provider.py`) work together to:

- Analyze code dependencies between files
- Map imports and exports across the codebase
- Identify related files that might be affected by changes
- Provide context for making informed repair decisions

### 2. Repair System

The repair system centered around the PatcherAgent (`triangulum_lx/tooling/repair.py`) provides:

- Relationship-aware bug analysis 
- Automatic patch generation based on bug context
- File backup and rollback mechanisms for safe patching
- Impact analysis for understanding potential side effects
- Verification of patches via automated testing

### 3. Test Runner

The test runner (`triangulum_lx/tooling/test_runner.py`) enables:

- Automatic discovery of tests related to specific files
- Safe execution of tests in isolated environments
- Validation of patches through test results
- Feedback on test failures to guide repair strategies

### 4. Documentation and Examples

Comprehensive documentation has been created:

- `docs/self_healing.md`: Detailed guide to the self-healing system
- `docs/Triangulum_Next_Steps_Roadmap.md`: Future development roadmap
- `examples/self_healing_demo.py`: Working demonstration of self-healing

## Recently Completed Work

As part of the recent implementation plan, we have:

1. **Fixed and enhanced core components**:
   - Updated the Engine to properly initialize the Router
   - Integrated the Router, Coordinator, and Meta-Agent
   - Fixed import issues across packages

2. **Implemented robust self-healing capabilities**:
   - Created the PatcherAgent with relationship-aware bug analysis
   - Implemented file backup and rollback mechanisms
   - Added impact analysis for understanding patch side effects
   - Integrated code relationship analysis with the repair system

3. **Developed testing and verification systems**:
   - Created a comprehensive test runner
   - Implemented test discovery for files
   - Added support for test-driven verification of patches

4. **Created comprehensive documentation**:
   - Written detailed self-healing documentation
   - Provided usage examples and best practices
   - Created a roadmap for future development

5. **Demonstrated full self-healing workflow**:
   - Created a working self-healing demonstration
   - Verified correct operation of all components
   - Validated the full repair pipeline

## Next Steps

While the core self-healing functionality is now implemented, significant work is still needed to make Triangulum production-ready. Key next steps include:

1. **Multi-Agent Communication Framework** for OpenAI o3 integration
2. **Scaling to Folder-Level Repairs** with thousands of files
3. **Production-Grade Infrastructure** with security and monitoring
4. **Enhanced Learning Capabilities** to improve over time
5. **Enterprise Deployment Readiness** for real-world use

Full details on these next steps are available in the `docs/Triangulum_Next_Steps_Roadmap.md` file.
