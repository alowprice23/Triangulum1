# Triangulum Project Analysis and Self-Healing Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Triangulum codebase and outlines the plan for its v2 upgrade.

## Architectural Recommendations

1. **Clear Component Separation**: Maintain clear boundaries between system components, following the principle of separation of concerns.
2. **Unified Self-Healing System**: Consolidate all self-healing functionality into a coherent system centered around the core engine.
3. **Relationship-Driven Analysis**: Leverage the relationship tree more effectively for system analysis and decision-making.
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Continue expanding test coverage to ensure system stability.
5. **Module Consolidation**: Reduce redundancy by consolidating overlapping functionality.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Restructuring**
   - Refactor core components for clarity and consistency
   - Establish clear interfaces between system modules

2. **Phase 2: Self-Healing Enhancement**
   - Consolidate self-healing mechanisms
   - Integrate relationship tree with self-healing

3. **Phase 3: Debug System Overhaul**
   - Replace ad-hoc debug scripts with a systematic debugging framework
   - Implement comprehensive logging and tracing

4. **Phase 4: Test Suite Expansion**
   - Expand unit test coverage
   - Implement integration tests for system components

5. **Phase 5: Documentation and Examples**
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Develop example applications demonstrating system capabilities
