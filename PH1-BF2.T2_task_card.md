# PH1-BF2.T2 - Fix Bug Detector Error Handling

## Objective
Improve error handling in the BugDetectorAgent to ensure robustness when dealing with various file types, malformed code, and exceptional conditions

## Files to touch / create
- triangulum_lx/agents/bug_detector_agent.py
- tests/unit/test_bug_detector_agent.py

## Definition-of-Done checklist
- [ ] Enhance error handling for file reading operations
- [ ] Implement proper exception handling for regular expression errors
- [ ] Add graceful degradation for unsupported file types
- [ ] Improve handling of malformed or encoded files
- [ ] Add detailed error reporting with actionable information
- [ ] Implement recovery mechanisms for partial analysis failures
- [ ] Update documentation with error handling patterns

## Test strategy
- Test with invalid/corrupted files to verify proper error handling
- Verify edge cases like empty files, binary files, and very large files
- Test with malformed regular expressions to validate exception handling
- Validate error reporting provides useful diagnostic information
- Verify partial results are still returned when portions of analysis fail

## Risk flags & dependencies
- Critical for robust folder-level bug detection
- Affects system stability when working with diverse codebases
- Required to prevent cascading failures in orchestration workflows
- May impact performance for large-scale analysis
