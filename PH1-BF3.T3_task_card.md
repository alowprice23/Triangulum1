# PH1-BF3.T3 - Fix System Startup Sequence

## Objective
Improve the Triangulum system startup sequence to ensure proper initialization, component loading, and error handling during the system bootstrapping process

## Files to touch / create
- triangulum_lx/core/engine.py
- triangulum_lx/providers/factory.py
- triangulum_lx/agents/agent_factory.py
- triangulum_self_heal.py
- tests/unit/test_system_startup.py

## Definition-of-Done checklist
- [ ] Implement dependency-aware component initialization
- [ ] Add proper error handling during startup sequence
- [ ] Create recovery mechanisms for partial startup failures
- [ ] Add detailed logging throughout the startup process
- [ ] Implement startup configuration validation
- [ ] Add diagnostic checks to verify system health after startup
- [ ] Create graceful shutdown procedures for cleanup

## Test strategy
- Test startup with various configuration combinations
- Validate error handling during component initialization failures
- Test recovery from non-critical component failures
- Verify proper resource allocation and cleanup
- Test startup performance with different component configurations

## Risk flags & dependencies
- Critical for system usability and reliability
- Affects all subsequent operations after startup
- Required for proper agent initialization and communication
- Dependencies between components must be carefully managed
