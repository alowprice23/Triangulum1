# Command-Line Agent (CLA)
#
# This script provides autonomous oversight of the Triangulum shell. It can
# inspect, spawn, and restart agent containers, execute shell commands on a
# virtual TTY, monitor progress against the roadmap, and invoke the triage
# domain automatically when the system is stuck or after three consecutive
# command failures.
#
# To start the application, run the following command:
#
# tsh --help
#

while true; do
  # Main loop for the CLA
  sleep 10
done
