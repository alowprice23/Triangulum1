# PH1-S1.3.T3: Enhance Verification Agent Testing

## Objective
Enhance the Verification Agent's testing capabilities with improved test generation, validation techniques, and feedback mechanisms to ensure more reliable verification of bug fixes.

## Files to Touch / Create
- triangulum_lx/agents/verification_agent.py
- tests/unit/test_verification_agent.py
- examples/enhanced_verification_agent_demo.py

## Definition-of-Done Checklist
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test generation based on bug context
- [ ] Add automated verification environment setup
- [ ] Create property-based testing for patch validation
- [ ] Implement sandbox isolation for secure testing
- [ ] Add regression test suite generation
- [ ] Enhance verification metrics and scoring
- [ ] Implement detailed feedback for failed verifications
- [ ] Create integration testing with implementation agent
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Develop demonstration example showing enhanced verification capabilities

## Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Expand tests for all new verification agent functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Test integration with Strategy and Implementation Agents
- **Meta-Testing**: Test the verification agent's own testing capabilities
- **Edge Cases**: Verify handling of complex code structures and language features

## Risk Flags & Dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Requires coordination with Implementation Agent's patches
- **Risk**: False positives in verification results
- **Risk**: Test environment differences vs. production
- **Risk**: Security concerns with dynamic code execution
- **Risk**: Performance overhead for comprehensive testing
