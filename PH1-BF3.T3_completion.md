## Implementation Details

### Dependency-Aware Component Initialization
- Implemented a topological sort algorithm in TriangulumEngine to determine the correct initialization order
- Added circular dependency detection to prevent initialization errors
- Supports both sequential and parallel initialization modes with proper dependency handling

### Error Handling During Startup
- Added detailed error tracking during component initialization
- Implemented retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Properly captures and logs initialization errors for diagnostics

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Implemented SystemStartupManager with three recovery strategies:
  1. Retry with sequential initialization instead of parallel
  2. Disable problematic components and retry
  3. Use minimal configuration for critical operations

### Startup Logging and Monitoring
- Added detailed logging throughout the startup process
- Created StartupDashboard for real-time monitoring of startup status
- Tracks component initialization times and dependencies

### Configuration Validation
- Added validation of configuration before startup begins
- Checks for required configuration sections and keys
- Provides detailed error messages for invalid configurations

### Health Diagnostics
- Implemented system health checks after startup
- Monitors component status and interactions
- Provides detailed health reports for system diagnostics

### Graceful Shutdown
- Added proper resource cleanup during shutdown
- Implemented dependency-aware shutdown sequence (reverse of initialization)
- Ensures all components are properly terminated

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests for each component of the startup system
- Integration tests for the complete startup process
- Test cases for error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Test runner script for easy execution of startup tests

## Verification
- All test cases pass
- System successfully starts up with proper dependency handling
- Error handling correctly manages initialization failures
- Recovery mechanisms successfully recover from various failure scenarios
- Health monitoring accurately reports system status
