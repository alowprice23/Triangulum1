# Triangulum Testing Progress Summary

## Tests Completed So Far

### ✅ PASS: Incremental Analysis
- **Result**: 9.20x speedup factor achieved
- **Status**: Fully functional
- **Notes**: Incremental analysis is significantly faster than full analysis

### ✅ PASS: Repair Planning  
- **Result**: Successfully detected bug and created repair plan
- **Status**: Fully functional
- **Details**:
  - Created repair plan ID: ea59c357-f9eb-45fa-b482-4bde4d7dc926
  - Found issue: Silent exception handling in MetricBus.publish method
  - Successfully validated repair plan consistency
  - Dry-run execution successful

### ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS: Dependency Graph Analysis
- **Result**: Graph built but 0 dependencies found
- **Status**: Building graph structure works, but dependency detection fails
- **Issues**: Function signature mismatch in patched `process_file` method
- **Impact**: All features that depend on dependency detection are affected

### ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS: Relationship Analysis
- **Result**: Runs without errors but finds 0 relationships 
- **Status**: Agent functional but underlying dependency detection broken
- **Issues**: Same root cause as dependency graph analysis
- **Impact**: Relationship context for repairs is missing

## Current System Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Incremental analysis performance optimization
- ✅ Repair planning and validation 
- ✅ Bug detection for repair planning
- ✅ Dry-run repair execution
- ✅ File modification tracking
- ✅ Basic agent communication

### Broken Features  
- ❌ Dependency relationship detection
- ❌ Import analysis in code files
- ❌ Function call relationship mapping
- ❌ Complete dependency graph construction

### Root Cause Analysis
The core issue appears to be in `triangulum_lx/tooling/dependency_graph_path_fix.py` where the patched `process_file` method has a function signature mismatch:
```
Error: fix_dependency_graph_builder.<locals>.patched_process_file() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
```

This is preventing the dependency graph from analyzing actual file relationships, which impacts:
- Relationship analysis
- Impact boundary calculations  
- Comprehensive repair planning
- Cross-file dependency tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Fix dependency graph processing** - Resolve the function signature mismatch
2. **Test bug detection** - Verify comprehensive bug detection works
3. **Test multi-file repair** - Verify repairs can be applied across files
4. **Test verification agent** - Verify repairs can be validated
5. **Test orchestrator agent** - Verify agent coordination works

## Testing Priority

**CRITICAL** - Must fix dependency graph processing before continuing with advanced tests, as most features depend on accurate relationship analysis.

**HIGH** - Continue with bug detection and repair application tests since repair planning already works.

**MEDIUM** - Test agent coordination and learning features after core functionality is verified.
