Third test file with various content.
This file will help test our file processing script.
The original code had a resource leak
because it didn't properly close file handles.
This could lead to running out of file descriptors
if processing many files in a large directory structure.
The fixed version uses a context manager (with statement)
to ensure files are properly closed after being used.
