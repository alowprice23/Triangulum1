# PH1-BF2.T3 - Implement Timeout and Progress Tracking

## Objective
Enhance the agent system with robust timeout handling and detailed progress tracking to improve reliability and observability during long-running operations

## Files to touch / create
- triangulum_lx/core/monitor.py
- triangulum_lx/agents/base_agent.py
- triangulum_lx/agents/orchestrator_agent.py
- triangulum_lx/monitoring/metrics.py
- tests/unit/test_timeout_handling.py

## Definition-of-Done checklist
- [ ] Implement configurable timeout mechanism for agent operations
- [ ] Add progress tracking with percentage completion estimation
- [ ] Create event emission system for operation milestones
- [ ] Implement graceful cancellation for timed-out operations
- [ ] Add detailed logging of progress events
- [ ] Create dashboard metrics for monitoring operation progress
- [ ] Update agent API to expose progress information

## Test strategy
- Test timeout handling with deliberately slow operations
- Verify progress tracking accuracy across different operation types
- Test cancellation mechanism for partially completed operations
- Validate metrics collection for dashboard integration
- Test with concurrent operations to ensure isolation

## Risk flags & dependencies
- Critical for reliability of long-running folder analysis operations
- Affects user experience during large-scale repairs
- Required for proper orchestration of multi-agent workflows
- Dependent on monitoring infrastructure components
